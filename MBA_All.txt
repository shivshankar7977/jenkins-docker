Dear mam,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that my salary for the month of June 2024 does not seem to be as expected. I had only one leave in June, and I had already communicated my call and leave schedule at the end of the month.

Could you please review my records and let me know if there was any error?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Shivshankar
